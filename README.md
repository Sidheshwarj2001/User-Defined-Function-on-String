# User-Defined-Function-on-String
This repository is a collection of C program challenges centered around user-defined functions for string manipulation. Each problem statement encourages the implementation of functions to perform tasks such as counting characters, toggling case, finding specific characters, and more. Ideal for practicing string handling.
'Certainly! Here's a short README file tailored for a Git repository focused on C language problem statements related to user-defined functions for string operations:

## Overview

This repository contains a series of programming challenges, each focusing on different aspects of string operations. You will find tasks that involve counting characters, converting cases, searching for specific characters, replacing substrings, and more.

## Structure

Each challenge is organized into its own folder. Inside each folder, you will typically find:

- **README.md**: Detailed description of the problem statement.
- **starter_code.c**: Template file with function prototypes and basic structure.
- **input.txt**: Sample input data for testing your solution.
- **output.txt**: Expected output corresponding to the sample input.
